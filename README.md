# Decode-GPT-4
We try to re-imagine and create the algorithms and functions in the class of the latest GPT 4 release capabilities. This repository is for fun and learning purposes for any python enthusiast, you are invited to contribute.
We start to decode this from minute 3 of the live presentation on OpenAI you tube channel to re-imagine the Algorithm behind the python functions in the class that summaries the article, where every word starts with G to 1 sentence.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ&t=1203s 
I believe that ChatGPT source code is divided into 3 segments:

  - U.I segment.
  - Instruction segment
  - Functionality Segment

The U.I segment is used to display what we see and pick what we feed it with
The instruction segment picks the instructions that we pass to it
The functionality segment implements the requested funtionality from the instruction segment
In this repo we are only decoding the functionality part of GPT4
This is an open source code contribution and it is only for learning and personal exploration purposes.
